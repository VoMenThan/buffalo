<p><strong>THERE IS A CHAMPION IN EVERY CHILD. WE ARE COMMITTED TO HELPING BUILD COMMUNITIES WHERE ALL KIDS CAN THRIVE, COMPETE AND BELONG TO A TEAM.</strong></p>
<p><span>We're teaming up with Boys &amp; Girls Club of America (BGCA) to help more kids play team sports. By 2020, we are donating more than&nbsp;</span><span>$16</span><span>&nbsp;million to fund football, basketball, and cheer programs at local Boys &amp; Girls Clubs across the country through corporate and Guest donations. In 2015, Buffalo Wild Wings was able to provide $2.8 million dollars to fund ALL STAR</span><span>S</span><span>&nbsp;grants to expose more kids to the benefits of participating in team sports and belonging to a team.</span></p>
<p>Join the effort through purchasing a sauce or seasoning bottle where $1 from each bottle goes to Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America, or dine-in during our annual Community Day on April 19, 2017 where 10% of all sales go to local Boys &amp; Girls Clubs. With your support, we can help change the game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Playing sports is about igniting a passion, belonging to a team, sportsmanship, teamwork and building self-esteem through great play. We believe every child should have the chance to experience team sports and learn the life lessons and&nbsp;skills that will help them thrive and compete in life. That’s why we’re committed to helping all kids have the opportunity to play on a team.</p>
