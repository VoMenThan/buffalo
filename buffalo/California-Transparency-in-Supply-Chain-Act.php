          <p>Buffalo Wild Wings, Inc. (“BWW”) provides this statement about its obligations under the Calif. Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. The Act requires BWW to disclose its efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from its direct supply chain.</p>
<p>At BWW we believe in doing the right thing. As stated in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, BWW expects its suppliers to respect applicable laws and to behave in an ethical manner. While BWW does not presently engage in verification of its product supply chain, audit its suppliers or require certifications regarding the supplies that it receives, we expect our suppliers to conduct their activities in compliance with all applicable laws including those that require them to treat workers fairly, respect human rights and provide a safe and healthy work environment.</p>
<p>In coming years, BWW intends to evaluate the ways that it may reduce the risk of slavery and human trafficking in its direct supply chain which may include developing internal accountability standards and providing training to those who have direct responsibility for supply chain management regarding mitigating the risk of slavery and human trafficking in BWW's supply chain.</p>
